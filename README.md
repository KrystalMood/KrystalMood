## 🚀 About Me

Self-taught developer with a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly interfaces. I believe in the power of continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in frontend development. Sometimes I get a bit delusional with my coding ambitions, but that's what makes the journey exciting! 🚀

```text
Core:         TypeScript, JavaScript
Frontend:     Remix.js, Next.js, Vite, HTML/CSS

    frameworks: ["Remix.js", "Next.js"],
    buildTool: "Vite",
